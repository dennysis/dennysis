# Hi there, I'm Dennis! 👋

- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersections of technology, art, and science. I have a passion for software development, AI, and open-source projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced machine learning techniques, cloud computing, and improving my skills in React and Node.js.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that aim to make a positive impact, especially in the fields of education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via email at muthonidennis546@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn [here](https://).
- 😄 Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or playing the guitar.

Feel free to check out my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on something exciting!
